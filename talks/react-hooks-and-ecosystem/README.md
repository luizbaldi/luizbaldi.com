# Parcel spectacle boilerplate

## Why
This is a minimalist alternative to the boilerplate provided by the Spectacle team, containing a simple structure do develop your presentations using React.

I also decided to use Parcel because of its simplicity.

## Getting Started

1. Download the boilerplate

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:luizbaldi/parcel-spectacle-boilerplate.git
  ```

2. Remove existing version control

  ```sh
  rm -R .git
  ```

3. Install dependencies

  ```sh
  yarn
  ```

4. Start the webpack server. The server will run at [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234).

  ```sh
  yarn build
  ```

### Build
To build the project, just run

  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```

And the dist will be generated at `build` folder.
