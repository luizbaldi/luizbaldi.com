      Hi ðŸ‘‹
      <p>
        As a Software engineer focused on JavaScript and Elixir and specialized
        in React and React Native, I usually build custom solutions for web and
        mobile platforms. I spend most of the time doing front-end development
        through a functional perspective, architecting solutions, and
        experimenting with animations.

        I'm also a board member of a brazilian podcast called{" "}

        , and I've been trying to learn more about creative programming.
